# Intro to Open Source Presentation

These are the visual slides for an intro to open source presentation given at [MINK WIC](https://www.minkwic.org/) 2019.

This presentation was created using Google Slides and can most easily be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1meD-NcMTH2VvD_GxUP4CkvJ9mVnruNkEHWrL1kKldf4/edit?usp=sharing).

The presentation has also been converted to a Microsoft PowerPoint version and can be downloaded from this repo.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out! Feedback is always welcome. My contact info can be found on the last slide. Thank you!
